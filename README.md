In this project, I used Beautiful Soup to scrape data from a booking website. 
By data, I mean the residence address, monthly price, and the link to view the residence. 
Then, I stored all this data in different lists to later fill out an automated form using Selenium. 
The form had three questions: one for the address, one for the price, and one for the link. 
With Selenium, I automated these fillings so that for each residence found on the site, it would automatically fill out the form. 
The form's link is included in the code, as well as the website from which I retrieved all the residences.
